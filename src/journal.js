The consequence is that I don't want to move my entire app to aws, instead only host the REST API server. This requires however, that I install an SSL certificate for the domain name of the server. I just found out that I don't need to get a domain name and that I can just install what's called a \"self-signed certificate for development and testing purposes\". I am now reading a very good article about how to self sign such a certificate.\n Note to self: for a self signed security certificate the common name (aka domain name) must be max 64 bytes. Mine was longer, so I had to delete the app and the code pipeline and create new ones. (Advantage: more practice) On this occasion I also changed the region from US Virginia to EU Frankfurt - I don't know yet what difference this makes.",
